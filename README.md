Create an app
First thingâ€™s first: before you start developing with Bolt, youâ€™ll want to create a Slack app.

ðŸ’¡ We recommend using a workspace where you wonâ€™t disrupt real work getting done â€” you can create a new one for free.

After you fill out an app name (you can change it later) and pick a workspace to install it to, hit the Create App button and youâ€™ll land on your appâ€™s Basic Information page.

This page contains an overview of your app in addition to important credentials youâ€™ll need later, like the Signing Secret under the App Credentials header.

Update ```.env ``` file with your slack auth

# Setting up your project
```
yarn install
node app.js
```
